=====================================

Welcome to the OSFM documentation. OSFM is a powerful Python module designed for network system management. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the OSFM module, its features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

**Overview of OSFM**
--------------------

OSFM is a dual-mode Python module that provides comprehensive solutions for remote file management and system access across your IT infrastructure. Operating in both Server and Client modes, OSFM enables administrators to efficiently manage applications, user accounts, network access, and remote desktop connections from a centralized location.

**File-Level Documentation**
---------------------------

The OSFM module consists of multiple files, each with its own specific functionality. The main files are:

*   `index.py`: This is the main entry point of the OSFM module. It defines the `Index` class, which returns the JSX components for the OSFM interface.
*   `components/`: This directory contains the JSX components used in the OSFM interface, including `Navigation`, `Hero`, `Section`, `Features`, and `CodeBlock`.
*   `ui/`: This directory contains the UI components used in the OSFM interface, including the `Button` component.

**Function-Level Documentation**
------------------------------

The OSFM module uses several functions to manage the interface and functionality. Some of the key functions are:

*   `Index()`: This function returns the JSX components for the OSFM interface.
*   `render()`: This function is used to render the JSX components.
*   `useEffect()`: This function is used to handle side effects, such as initializing the OSFM server or client.

**Installation and Usage**
-------------------------

To install OSFM, follow these steps:

1.  Install Python 3.11 or higher.
2.  Install pip package manager.
3.  Run the command `pip install osfm` to install OSFM and its dependencies.
4.  Verify the installation by running the command `python -c 'import osfm; print(osfm.__version__)'`.

To use OSFM, follow these steps:

1.  Initialize OSFM in server mode by running the command `python -m osfm --server`.
2.  Connect to an OSFM server and run in client mode by running the command `python -m osfm --client`.

**API Documentation**
--------------------

The OSFM module provides several APIs for managing the interface and functionality. Some of the key APIs are:

*   `osfm.server()`: This API initializes the OSFM server.
*   `osfm.client()`: This API connects to an OSFM server and runs in client mode.
*   `osfm.get_version()`: This API returns the version of OSFM.
